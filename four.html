    <h3>Improving accessibility of HTML</h3>
    
    <ol><li>
        <h4>Text content</h4>
        having well-structured content that includes heading,paragraph,and lists is one of the most helpful
        accessibility features for users who rely on screen readers.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Page layouts </h4>Although it is possible to design a layout using nested &lt;div&gt; elements,
        it is preferable to utillise proper sectioning elements to encapsulate your main navigation (&lt;nav&gt;)
        ,footer(&lt;footer&gt;),repeated content units(&lt;article&gt;),and other relevent content.

    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>UI controls</h4>
        when referring to UI controls we are discussing the essential elements of web documents that users engage with,
        such as buttons,links, and form controls.
